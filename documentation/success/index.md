Since VerdictDB is an open-sourced project hosted on GitHub, we are unable to know exactly who or what companies are actively using.
However, we have interacted heavily with the following companies to help them deploy VerdictDB in their production environments.


**Walmart Labs**, a subsidiary of Walmart, one of the largest retail corporations.


**LOCALLY**, a Irvine-based company that provides location data intelligence and real-time consumer engagement.
